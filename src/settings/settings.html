				This page will help you setup your lolisafe extension so you can rehost images/audio/videos by right clicking on them.
				For this to work you need to provide the domain were lolisafe is running. If you want to keep track of your uploads and
				be able to create albums to store them, you should create an account on the website and paste the token here, so that every
				upload gets tied to your account, enabling you to go back to the site and see all of your uploaded files.

			<p>Domain on which lolisafe is running:</p>
			<input type="text" id="domain" placeholder="https://lolisafe.moe">

			<p>Your lolisafe token (optional):</p>
			<input type="text" id="token" placeholder="your-super-secret-token">
